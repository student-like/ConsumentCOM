INFO: on the homepage you find all the products which can be added, for now there is a .json list 
	of a test version of the app -> .jpg images + info txt for beer

> MainActivityJava

If you try the application check out the "logcat" there you will find the output of the app, including informations about the current day, what you are saving, how much in L, and where you are saving it. To find the output quicker use a filter looking for "INFO:" or simply search for it in the "6: AndroidMonitor".
