If you try the application check out the "logcat" there you will find the output of the app, including informations about the current day, what you are saving, how much in L, and where you are saving it. To find the output quicker use a filter looking for "INFOs” in the "6: AndroidMonitor".

Implemented and Working:
- ActionBar 
- TabbedBar 
- Database read_only from .JSON 
- List View in Tab “CONSUME”

TODO:
- Add history to HISTORY
- Add statistical view to STATS
- Add + button to add products
